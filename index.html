    <h1>Enoch Lai</h1>
    <p>I am a student at Washington University in St. Louis majoring in Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology. On this website you will some of my writings, some of which were previously private, and some of which will be written with a public audience in mind.</p>
    <p>I hope that you will be inspired through my collected writings. I hope that they challenge you and stir you. If they don't, I will have failed. I aim to be thoughtful in my writings, but I am not perfect, and what I write is, at best, reasoned opinion.</p>
